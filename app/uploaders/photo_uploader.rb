  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir
    "uploads/#{model.class.to_s.underscore}/#{mounted_as}/#{model.id}"

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  # Resize the photo to max width and height
  process resize_to_fit: [1920, 1080]

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do
    # resize this version to fill a box of width x height
    process resize_to_fill: [500, 300]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_whitelist
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
